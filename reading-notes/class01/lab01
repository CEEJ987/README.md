## Github

In class today, we learned about making repo's in Github, and how to deploy a page for that repo. I learned how to use markdown to create different forms of text for my repo. 

## [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview/)

Different syntax in Markdown allow you to create interesting things such as forming a website!

## Headings

In syntax in markdown I learned how to use "#'s" to edit heading sizes H1-H5. These headings get smaller with the more you have!

### Using Emphasis

In markdown you have the option to use things such as bold and italic fonts.

**Bold** is done with two **.

*Italic* is done with one *.

Bold and Italic is done with three ***.

***See!***

(Remember to use the *** before and after!).

And to remember the option "_" instead of "*".
